Improvements:

	All
		global positioning
		signal handling
		Add at least 2 sounds per game
		3 background musics
		work on margin from bottom of phone for sure, maybe from sides, probs from top
		add more clear directions.
		add more clearly defined win/loss conditions
		use the time/score better and make it more clear what is going on

	perry_says
		Make the buttons move or something
		Make timer for inactivity of player
		Make it move to a beat?
		Do I need to worry about cutting off the music?\

	perry_python


	perry_polo
		power ups
		check how the player and enemy move
			make them move in relation to event targets not at event target

	perry_llama
		better enemy visuals

	perry_dodge
		power ups

	perry_flap


	perry_run
		cleaning up
		make the timing of platforms and speed more uniform/related

	perry_skeeball


	perry_space
		especially double check signals to make sure things are clear/clean

	perry_squash
		make the snakes an animation to control the collision sizes better
		Why does being on or above the start position fuck it up?

	perry_putt:
		one more level
		sounds on wall hit
		move the putt button/make it bigger and easier to hit

	perry_tamagotchi:
		visuals

	perry_pinball


	perry_match



Keep:
	children_light_up.connect(Callable(node, "light_up"))

Future/ideas:
	rename sound Buses
	make controlling background music more fluid and all through the animation player, perhaps

	Card matching game

	Pinball

	Space Invaders (maybe)
	Frogger
	Breakout
	Jetpack Joyride

	Introduce at least 1 then 2 new game elements to make it fun
	If not too much of a detriment, add another way to lose.

	adjust canvaslayers (probably move everything up or down one)
		HUD 1
		GameStartOver 3
		Buttons 3
		Stuff 2
			HitMeter
			Status
		Background -2

How do I handle the different xatio's and the timing around moving nodes.
	Make it consistent with call deferred or a signal

Make things their own scene and arrange - get rid of /2's and such where possible
	Make scaling all 1
