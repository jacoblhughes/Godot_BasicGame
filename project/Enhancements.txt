V2:

All:
	Make level changes actually mean something
	Improved sounds (like from one place mainly)
	Improved background music
	Consolidate the sounds

How do I handle the different xatio's and the timing around moving nodes.
	Make it consistent with call deferred or a signal

Introduce at least 1 then 2 new game elements to make it fun
If not too much of a detriment, add another way to lose.

Add at least 2 sounds per game
3 background musics

Make things their own scene and arrange - get rid of /2's and such where possible

make scaling all 1

adjust canvaslayers (probably move everything up or down one)

	HUD 1
	GameStartOver3
	Buttons3
	HitMeter (stuff) 2

	background -2

perry_says
	Make the buttons move or something
	Make timer for inactivity of player
	Make it move to a beat?
	Do I need to worry about cutting off the music?

perry_python
	need to compare to snake length on when to spawn, not the score

perry_polo
	make the whirlpools fling instead of pull in (done?)
	make the player move in relation to event target not at event target (done?)
	make icons that give powerups or other things

perry_llama
	better enemies

perry_dodge
	powerups

perry_flap
	make the walls not fall

perry_run
	cleaning up

perry_space
	Rockets global position??
	rockets should emit signal back to game to handle game scoring and such

perry_squash
	Why does being on or above the start position fuck it up?

perry_squash:
	size of snakes and motion

perry_putt:
	one more level

perry_tamagotchi:
	buttons
	visuals


Keep:
	children_light_up.connect(Callable(node, "light_up"))

Future/ideas:
	rename sound Buses
	make controlling background music more fluid and all through the animation player, perhaps
	Card matching game
